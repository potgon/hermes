# Hermes
Hermes is a serverless, event-driven backend system designed to process and handle real-time financial events efficiently. Hermes ingests, validates, and distributes events such as transactions, alerts, and account updates, providing users with instant notifications and a live view of their data.

The system utilizes AWS serverless architecture (Fargate, SNS, SQS...), a Java/Kotlin backend, and integrates monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana for comprehensive real-time analytics. Hermes is built to be scalable, fault-tolerant, and optimized for high-throughput event processing, making it ideal for financial and transactional applications.
